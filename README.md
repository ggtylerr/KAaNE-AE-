# KAaNE [AE]
Keep Assisting and Nobody Explodes [Android Edition]

The KTaNE assistant app for Androids.

# Notes

This app is **NOT** available on the Google Play Store. Even after I make an APK available, I'll most likely release it on the store when the first beta build is out. I'll also have to pay a $25 license and I'm not planning on putting ads, so that's another reason why I'm not going to release it there for a while. I'm also not sure how lengthy their verification process is.

**In the home screen, there's a button that requests for storage permissions. The app absolutely needs these permissions for settings, logs, etc. KAaNE [AE] stores these files in /Downloads/kaane-ae-/. It does not collect any other information or use any other files.**

Vanilla Button and Keypad is currently a placeholder screen.

Config file is found in `Downloads/kaane-ae-/config.properties`. This will be changed whenever I figure out how to make a proper directory without Android freaking out.

If you have a small screen, the bomb settings might have cropped text. You can easily fix this by rotating your screen or by using an emulator.
