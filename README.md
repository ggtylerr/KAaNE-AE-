# KAaNE [AE]
Keep Assisting and Nobody Explodes [Android Edition]

The KTaNE assistant app for Androids.

# Notes

By default, files generated (like the config and log files) are stored in the internal app storage. To change this, go to the app settings (top right, settings), and press Location to change to external storage. You'll need to accept permissions in order to do this (you can do this from the home screen)

If you have a small screen, some modules (like the bomb settings) might have cropped text. You can easily fix this by rotating your screen or by using an emulator.
